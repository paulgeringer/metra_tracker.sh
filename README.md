###Usage###
 `metra_tracker <TRAIN_LINE> <DEPARTURE> <DESTINATION>`

 See the `train_keys.txt` file for the list of available train lines and
 station values. You must use the key value that's in all caps. I haven't
 written anything to fuzzy match inputs.

 This will print out all listed future scheduled trains for the selected route.
